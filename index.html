      <h2>Heading 1: Lulin the neighbourhood with bad reputation <em><b>(Backstory)</b></em></h2>
        <p>Lulin is one of the biggest neighbourhoods in Sofia Bulgaria. It's almost as big 
          as an ordinary village. <b>It's separated in 10 parts</b> (with 11th possibly beign made) Lulin
          1, Lulin 2, Lulin 3... and thus to Lulin 10. Every part has it's unique individuals 
          and characteristics. For example Lulin 4 is the gypsy part where all the gypsies 
          are selling their stock, stealing, partying and other stuff. For me the best part is 
          Lulin 7 where all of the bosses, drug dealers, hooligans and skinheads are meeting,
          I know almost everyone from them, and I have to say that they are not as bad as they are 
          describing them, <b>they all just try to "survive" in this God Forsaken place.</b> </p>
      <h2>Teenage life in Lulin</h2>
        <p>What about the teenage life there, well there is a lot going on. First of all most of us 
          are trying to show who is the alpha and that they are not the ones to be messed with, at 
          least I behave like that. But that is just a masque who we wear almost every time when we 
          are in the streets. When we are near loved ones, people who care about us and would 
          do anything for us we put that masque down and just start beign ourselves. Even if outside 
          we are beign defined as punks, hools, etc. in the eyes of the right people, we are just 
          confused, misunderstood children who had to grow up faster than they had to.</p>
